This work aims at designing a remote communication system for deaf-blind people where
we focus on implementing state-of-the-art algorithms for 3d hand pose estimation using dif-
ferent approaches like deep learning, semi-supervised learning and random forest classifier.
It involves the integration of haptic and robotic interfaces together with CNN based approaches
for hand pose estimation and remote reproduction of tactile sign language (t-SL) by using one 3D printed bio-mimetic robotic hand.
