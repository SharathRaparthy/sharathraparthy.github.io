The aim of the project is to transfer the motion between human subjects in different videos using 
generative adversarial networks (GANs). We used an opensource implementation called OpenPose for 
detecting 2D pose keypoints for body, face and hand. We trained the GAN using google cloud virtual 
machine and used the architectures proposed in pix2pixHD paper.
