 In  this work, we build on the framework of self-play, allowing an agent to interact with itself in order to make progress on some unknown task. We use
 Active  Domain  Randomization and self-play to create a novel, coupled environment-goal 
 curriculum, where agents learn through progressively more difficult tasks and environment variations.
